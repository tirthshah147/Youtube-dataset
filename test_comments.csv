great review !! i am looking into buying a sony a6300 primarily for traveling. i know this may seem like a dumb question but i am new to photography.. with the capabilities of the smartphones (iphone 6) now a days is it worth it to spend the money on an a6300? i hope this isn't insulting. it seems our phones are equipped with a decent camera.. how would it differ using a mirrorless? i do have a desire to pick up photography as a hobby and after reading up and watching countless videos it does seem like this is a good choice of camera for me so i was curious. thank you !!,0.9848

Thank you for your amazing videos, Could you please give me your opinion and answer some of my questions, i really really appreciate.

- I just bought A6300 and after some review and searches online i decided to buy complete adapter and also bought an expensive canon lens 16-35mm.

My only problem is that i am having problems taking videos with this sense, it does not focus automatically i think and my videos are not sharp, i tried to change the AUTOFOCUS to continues and it tells me not valid for the lens.


1- Did i buy the wrong lens or i am missing something else
2- should i just sell it again and try to get the sony original lenses?

You've made a subscriber out of me.  I currently have a Canon t2i and would consider myself a hobbyist that enjoys high quality video and photos just for social media and friends.  Do you think it would be smarter to sell my camera and purchase the Sony a6000 or shell out for the Sony a6300.  I would primarily use this for travel photography and small personal projects using a 50mm and the 10-18mm.,0.8555

"HEllo i am planning to buy a camera i am thinking of a6300 with FE 24-70mm F4 ZA OSS what do you think these are good combination? i am also thinking about canon 760D can you please suggests me. Thankyou

and yes which lens you used in this video with sonya6300",0.7845
"After many years of experience on Nikon (F70, D80, D90, D7000, D7200,Panasonic X9200 Camcorder) I decided to sell all the gear and get something less weight for photos and filming in one body.
I chose to go for mirorless, because they are more compact and lighter. After several searches and testing some cameras i had to choose between Sony A6300 and Panasonic GX8. It was hard because every camera has its advantages and disadvantages, both cameras are very good and they have photo and video quality (4k) very good in comparison with other mirorless in the same price segment.
Number of available lenses is a big decision factor while choosing your interchangeable lens camera. When we look at the available lenses for these two cameras, we see that Panasonic GX8 has an advantage over Sony A6300. The Panasonic offers a much larger array of lens options from Panasonic, Olympus and other third parties, on the other hand there are only 50 lenses for Sony A6300's Sony E (NEX) lens mount and they are ridiculously expensive.  ISO range of the Sony A6300 is more broad and another biggest advantage is the larger sensor area compared to the Panasonic GX8 43 sensor.  More ISO will sure help you get neat and clean night-shots without noise banding or color noise, Sony getting a full stop better performance due to the sensor. Dual IS in Panasonic GX8 is un-comparable, Panasonic becomes the world first company to feature Dual IS in a camera system, the Panasonic GX8 comes with built in sensor shift IS mechanism and when you add a OIS lens in the camera, the camera IS system sync with the Lens based IS system to give you ultimate result, Sony A6300 doesn't have this feature so you have to buy a lens with optical stabilization feature.The GX8 has a better EVF, touch screen, touch focus, and fully articulated screen; the Sony A6300 has none of those 

But in the end, the ratio of quality and price made me decide in favor of Panasonic GX8
Sony A6300 (998$) + Sony Vario-Tessar T FE 16-35mm f/4 ZA OSS (1248$) = 2246$ ,weight - 518gr. body+ 404gr. lenses = 922gr.
Panasonic GX8 (997$) + Panasonic Lumix G X Vario 12-35mm f/2.8 Asph (697$) = 1649$ , weight - 487gr. body + 305gr. lenses = 792gr. We have a difference of  597 $
With the difference of $ 597 can buy more accessories for the camera but what I found more interesting and useful is - ikan Beholder MS1 3-Axis Motorized Gimbal Stabilizer (599$) or  Big Balance Gibbon GN3 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal (600$)",0.9725
what mic are you using on the 6300? sounds great!,0.6588
I was at Best But today checking out this camera and it doesn't zoom at all. Its a fixed lens right? can a detachable lens fix that? also love the macro and fast focusing.,0.8677
"Hi Armando, This is a great video. May I ask what model of Speedbooster you are using? Did you have A6300 over-heating problem? What about battery life? Thank you in advance. Michael",0.6641
I've watched several videos about the a6300 and as an old man and a young camera guy I'm very interested in this camera. Own a canon now but am going to buy the a6300 but not sure about the lens yet. Thanks for a great review and you sold me! It will be my next camera just have to make up my mind on a lens. May be the sigma 18-35 art lens with the mc-11. Thanks again.,0.9348

I have an nx500 its pretty great. I love its articulating screen is oled which means the photos actually look nice unlike a washed out lcd.
