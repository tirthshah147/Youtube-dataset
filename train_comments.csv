I have a question.
I'm falling in love with the idea of making birding photography here in Mexico city and I haven't  had a decent camera in about a decade. If I was to buy  a DSLR, I would definitelly get the Canon SL2,  with a telephoto (I love the cutenes of its size and it's tons of features), but that is out of my budget.
Now within the superzoom cameras I was considering to just get a Kodak AZ 421 because it's 42x optical zoom and price. But, have you had any experiences with that Kodak? I know you are not into wildlife photography (maybe) , but maybe you know or any of your friends might know if being that much cheaper, the Kodak performs good for the task. Any ideas?",0.9419

The 80D is perfect for my needs and I am really happy with it. But the rode videomic go picks up awful interference from cell phones/computers/routers. It ruins footage with terrible audio. The only help anyone has given has been to ""turn off your router and phone"". Which is not possible when I am online working and also recording video.

"Sounds like a pretty good camera. One thing it will lack as a DSLR is the capability of being used for streaming via a capture card. Also you kinda always make it sound like mirror-less is worse than DSLR. This is absolutely not the case. In my case, I'm looking at the Sony a5100 as a second camera for video and streaming as it has a clean image setting for HDMI out. Granted, I'm already invested in the Sony ecosystem, but DSLR cannot be used for streaming because of the mirror that won't stay up for a few hours.

But as I said it seems like a pretty good camera and one clever thing about stating out with it is, you can actually adapbt cannon(or any SLR) lenses to mirrorless, so if you chose to go for a mirror-less later, you will at least have your old canon glass to use to begin with :o)",0.977

"I think I've found my first dslr camera! I saw this in store at a local BestBuy and was amazed how petite it was while still having a nice deep dslr handle grip and feel. The store dealers obviously wanted to persuade me to go up the line to the T7i and even the EOS 70D (because sell higher = meeting quota quicker), but even still I was very magnetized to the SL2 and felt it would be perfect for where I am in photography. As mentioned in this video, it has the dslr fitment which means I can invest into dslr lenses (which is the important long term factor anyways) and because it is so small, when I decide to get into street photography, this will be much less intimidating than say a Nikon D750 or worse, a Canon 1D lol.",0.7705

I've already watched your other video about lenses, where you were recommending the 24mm as the YouTube lens, but in almost all your videos, in the description it says you're using the 10-18 mm one. So I'm not sure which one to go for?  Would the 24mm one work with the Ring Light, considering the ring light needs to be close to you, but the 24mm lens it's more ""zoomed"" in than the 10-18mm one, in order to achieve a similar shoot like yours, capturing half way up of the body?

I had none and that has never been an issue for me! Wanna track high speed objects? Use the center one and keep you subject on focus!

It has a Canon 10x Optical Zoom HD Video Lens, Canon HD CMOS pro image sensor, Canon Digic DV III image processor, Optical Image Stabilizer and a 3.5"" swing out (selfie mode) touch screen. I usually shoot at 24P in FXP mode, it will also shoot 60i, PF24, or PF30 in MXP, XP+, SP, or LP mode. It is capable of full 1080p. It has an input for an external mic, and an ""S"" Mini Advanced Shoe (which I don't know what would fit on there).

Battles won by Canon SL2 - Dual Pixel Auto focus, lens selection, little bit more affordable, full size sensor
Battles won by Panasonic G85 - IBIS, 4k (more future proof?)

Interesting because they're both probably close in size, and price really. Auto focus is hard to give up...so if you went with this Canon you could make up some of the image stabilization you sacrifice from the G85 depending on what lens you bought or gimble. And since the Canon's probably about $150-200 cheaper than the G85, if you bought the body only maybe for the same price that stabilized lens could get you a pretty good package.

"Hello Max, My name is Kathryn. I am thinking about buying a camera so I can cam-record the YouTube videos, then re-upload that same video back onto YouTube since YouTube can automatically add subtitles to any video that didn't have any on the video. So since I will be only 3 feet away from my computer recording these videos off of YouTube; what would be the best camera (especially prefect audio quality)? if I record videos off YouTube then reput them back on to YouTube so they have subtitles added to them then recorded, or download this time to my computer. will the quality still be the same?  

For example: 1# record YouTube_2# up load to YouTube_ #3 downlod new video with subtitles. will the audio and clearly be the same as it was in the first place of the YouTube?  

Do I need a lense even though I will only be 3 feet away from my computer?
Do I need I microphone? is that what makes the sound quality prefect?
Do need a special camera because, I am recording off of a computer screen? when I take a picture there are special waves that come off the computer when I take the picture with my andriod. I was wondering is this also the same with cameras recording other techology like computers? 
If so are there special cameras for this?
would you happen to know: (the type of name) of these kinds of cameras made specially for recording other techonolgy like computers?)

"Both Mirrorless and DSLR bodies very much have their own places in photography. I see a lot of fanboys on both sides and I find them all very silly. (I happen to own a Nikon DSLR) If, for example, you're gonna go out and shoot photos of wildlife, you'd be better of with a DSLR most of the time. DSLRs are bulkier, but sometimes that bulk and heft is a good thing. They offer better ergonomics when dealing with really long and heavy telephoto lenses. Mirrorless bodies get very nose heavy with larger lenses on them. On the flip side, if you were doing some Street Photography, a mirrorless Camera would be fantastically advantageous. Fitting a prime lens on a Mirrorless body makes for a camera not much bigger than a point and shoot and you can be much more discreet/less intimidating to your subjects, offering for better natural candid shots. There are many more examples for both camps. I just don't understand why people feel the need to say one is always better than the other in everything, always. It's just childish and flat out wrong. Do some research, find out what kinds of pictures you want to take, then pic a camera style that fits your needs.

"This channel isn't biased towards the Sony A7 or anything. But you forgot to mention one very important aspect (and major disadvantage of mirrorless) and that's the fact that there is no physical shutter protecting the sensor from dirt. dust, and the environment in general. This is the number 1 reason why I would never own a mirrorless over a DSLR. All it takes is one grain of dirt being brushed away to scratch that very expensive sensor, rendering the camera useless, unless of course you'd like to pay for a very expensive replacement sensor. Not to say DSLRs don't get dust o the sensor on occasion but the odds are way lower than mirrorless.

- ergonomics is far better with a DSLR
- the choice of speedlights and their accesories for mirrorless systems is very limited
- the only full frame mirrorless system (Sony FE) suffers from very heavy vignetting due to mount not really suited for FF lenses
- mirrorless systems tend to be abandoned few years after the debut: see Pentax Q, Nikon 1 or Samsung NX
- DSLR sensor is much better protected egains, for example, accidental touch

The battery life is a real issue. It's not just about battery size, it's about having to have a screen running all the time. It's got to be way lower than 50%. I went on holiday recently with my DSLR. The battery went down by one bar throughout the whole time I was there. I can't even go out for the day with my kids without changing the battery on my mirrorless. It defeats the whole point of this small, light approach when you have to take a load of spare batteries around with you too.

There's also the fact that mirrorless cameras have to boot up.

"In mirrorless cameras the autofocus sensors and the auto exposure sensors are intergraded inside the digital image sensor. This is a compromise and isn't something new. Compact cameras are doing that since the birth of consumer digital cameras. The mirrorless cameras simply have by far better sensors than compact cameras and are equal in quality, speed to nearly all dSLRs. 
The dSLRs have dedicated sensors and that give them an advantage. The auto focus sensors of dSLRs are below the mirror  and the auto exposure sensor near the pentaprism. 
The top models and more expensive models of dSLR cameras have still better autofocus and auto exposure. The big expensive dSLR cameras don't have the compromise of size and weight and that helps the quality of dedicated electronics. 
On the other hand the modern electronics of mirrorless cameras are so advanced that a common photographer won't realize the difference. 
The mirrorless cameras is the future. However Canon, Nikon DSLRs cameras have the huge advantage of their lenses.  Sony, Olympus, Fujifilm etc offer only the basic number of lenses at an equal size and weight of dSLR's lenses. So in the aspect of lenses the mirrorless cameras are inferior. 
The big players Nikon Canon will survive due to theirs  lenses. Lenses are very hard to be made and are not under Moore's law like electronics. A really sharp and bright lens model can be profitable for at least a decade. Anything electronic is loosing its value after three years. 
Sony the last two years brought a decent variety of  full frame e-mount lenses for its mirrorless cameras. Sony nowadays is focused on full frame lenses and have neglected a little  the crop size APS-C e-mount lenses. Sony's full frame lenses for e-mount mirrorless cameras are more expensive and are equally heavy and big as they dSLR equivalent lenses. 
So we haven't seen any revolution in lenses yet. The major third party lens makers Sigma, Tamron offer some lenses for mirrorless cameras but their best lens models are made for dSLR cameras. 
Something that is not pointed as it should, is that Sony has great focus peaking, focus magnifier and internal image stabilization. Focus peaking and focus magnifier make manual focus much faster and easier than with dSLR camera. 
Sony and other manufacturers of mirrorless cameras have opened the road for the forgotten market of no electronic manual focus lenses. 
These lenses were neglected for decades. They were equally sharp at a much lower price. But most photographers were avoiding them because it was harder, slower to focus and the lack of internal image stabilization was increasing ISO. 
Now with mirrorless technology many previously unknown Chinese and Korean companies like Laowa, Rokinon, Zhongyi Mitagon have emerged. They don't have the knowledge of sophisticated autofocus and image stabilization electronics. Nevertheless they can produce smaller very sharp with big aperture lenses at a fraction of price. 
This is the unknown revolution of mirrorless cameras.",0.9777

Sony makes a comparison by showing one of the largest professional Canon dslrs out there. Why doing this? because they need to make a fuss out of the size debate by exaggeration. If DSLRs are big, that doesn't mean the ""mine is bigger than yours"" mentality. They're big because they were made with photographers needs in mind. Photographers need good ergonomics, they need grips to hold their damn cameras. They need battery life. They need great autofocus. They need a camera which doesn't heat up because of the small sensor housing. They need damn big convenient buttons. ""It's easy to change battery..."" Ha!

"Hey, Sony, how about fix the terrible shutter issues, firmware problems, software issues and garbage user interface. Use some decent batteries, even with two batteries it can not keep up with ONE battery from either Canon or Nikon. Your super expensive body, is not weather sealed. Owners of the A7 or A7RII are reporting their shutters getting stuck in cold weather. There are SO many things wrong with the A7R II, it is seriously a risk purchasing one from Sony. Customer service is terrible, and there are almost NO authorized Sony repair centers in the US. So, in conclusion.. Sony's mirrorless body A7 (Mark I or Mark II) are plagued with errors due to incompatible hardware, bad firmware and software, a terribly thought out user interface, a really unreliable shutter and is not weather sealed. This is why the net is plagued with A7Rs for sale and owners going back to tried and true Canon and Nikon bodies. Rugged, awesome firmware and user interface and amazing quality. Sony keeps releasing bodies than never get tested. The only time they're tested is on the consumer themselves, than try to repair it with ""firmware updates""",-0.9226

"Well, Sony, I don't mind mirrorless unlike many other folks, and, in fact, i've shot a lot with mirrorless before switching to Nikon and it was fun and had some advantages like, yes, adaptors, and zooming in to fine tune manual focus. But admitting the battery problem is not enough. It's just unfair to start with implying that a DSLR has noticeably LESS LIGHT coming both into their viewfinder and onto their focus sensor (which is borderline of BS), and immediately switch topic to how a mirrorless camera IS SMALLER. You can't forget that it's the mirrorless class that for ages had a problem with their electronic optical viewfinders in the dark, while DSLR's optical viewfinder just showed you what you could easily see with your own well adaptive eyes through some bright glass layers even when the camera is turned off. Not to mention, you can use live-view on a DSLR pretty well these days. And smaller does not mean better either, because the comfortable grip matters even more when you have a lens big by itself on a bloody slow third party adapter in front of your astonishingly 1.5x smaller square shaped body.

No one mentions how easily dust get's onto a mirrorless cameras sensor! It's the one thing that I hate about them. I barely ever had to get my 5diii cleaned for visible dust on the sensor but my a7s it's like once a month at least sometimes even more depending on how much I use it and how often I switch lenses even when taking all of the precautions to keep dust away.,0.3164
"""Sony has great lenses!"" picks up Canon L lens... ""Has great autofocus"" compare this to even a canon EOS-1 HV and it will lose. (thats a 15 year old camera too) and that DSLRs have both types of autofocus. Dont you think its smarter to use the sensor to take photos and have a separate AF sensor? you're gonna lose something by making one thing do both... This would have been better if it wasn't produced by Sony. Since very few mirrorless systems have a FF sensor (most being APS-C or MFT)i found it to be misleading. oh and really?... ""Only some of the light reaches the viewfinder, and if its dark, you may have trouble seeing your subject""... mind you, DSLRs have both a EVF and a OVF (and have 100% coverage on BOTH in some models) called live view. Nice try. If you are only doing in studio portraits, then Mirrorless works, everywhere else, it seems to fall short somewhere. Sports? haha good luck. The SLR has been around for decades, proven system. Mirrorless will die out eventually. (Maybe Sony went mirrorless because their SLR systems were no good?) Food for thought!",0.9449

Right now I'm looking at an A-7r ii and it's over 3k...

For battery life, another reason why DSLR's have better battery life is that they don't have to power the screen or process live view at all times. I find the two cameras battery life far more comparable when shooting video due to the fact DSLR's having to essentially turn into mirrorless cameras.",0.8271

"Sony is doing a great job with the new mirrorless camera line-up it is offering. No doubt, as this product technology starts to mature, they will be giving the pro DSLRs a run for their money. A side benefit of all this is that this technology is also pushing the DSLR manufacturers to innovate and drive new technology into this format. It is a shame however, that Sony feels it needs to put out such a one-sided argument about mirrorless. They have a great and innovative product, which, no doubt, will get there in time. So maybe instead of putting out such an easily dismissable marketing pitch against DSLRs, maybe they should focus on the many positives of their product.",0.936

I own a Canon 7D Mark ii and since a week a Sony a7 ii. I love all the pro's of Mirrorless concerning the weigth and the Image Quality but concerning autofocus it is not even Close especially if you take Advantage of the Option to adapt third Party lenses which reduces the Auto Focus capability even more or even delets it completly. I agree Auto fucus Speed is not needed for some Scenarios but for some like low light Party fotography or fast moving subjects it is very important to take a Picture in exact that Moment. With a nativ lens it is much better and you can use all the Focus Points but still not as locked on s my 7D. That i was Aware of as i bought the camera and allways saw it as a Addition to my bag not as a complete replacement.,0.9703

"Why on earth did Sony release really expensive (and huge) G series glass for FE bodies at the same launch as the a6300??    I doubt most NEX/a6* enthusiasts want the bulk and cost of FF lenses or bodies (HELLO).  Many folks are using older and affordable (and better) glass from other mounts on NEX/a6* bodies.  Hence the outcry (as seen on dpreview page for A6300 in the comments) from so many users (using adapters) about Sony NOT including IBIS.  Sony is already loosing the old NEX community to M43 Olympus, Panasonic, or their own RX line. Sony is simply not showing the love to their APS-C customers and don't seem to care about APS-C enthusiasts anymore. Sony a-mount is all but dead for a few years now (a68 is just a temporary bone).
